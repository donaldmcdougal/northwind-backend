# northwind-backend
A Java and MySQL backend for the northwind database that provides a REST interface

This project is intended for use in prototyping frontend work and does a pretty decent job at it.  I created it in order to prototype and test HTML/JavaScript clients but it can be used with anything that can make REST requests.

This project is definitely not for production use.  It allows requests from any origin and doesn't authenticate requests of any kind.  As long as it understands a request, it will simply carry it out.
